###Explain what the function does, provide at least one example of the use of the function and be prepared to present this topic on Monday.



###What is a function? What is a method? What is the difference (if any) between a function and a method?

*Short form: methods are associated with object instances or classes; functions aren't. When Python dispatches (calls) a method, then it binds the first parameter of that call to the appropriate object reference. (For most methods that's conventionally called self).

*All methods are functions but not all functions are methods.
