# What is GIL?  How does it interact with the heap stack and interpreter?

## Global Interpreter Lock


### let's take a step back.

A python script is first **compiled** to bytecode and then it is implemented (executed) by an **interpreter** like CPython\*, Jython or IronPython...

\* CPython is the original Python implementation. It is the implementation you download from Python.org. People call it CPython to distinguish it from other, later, Python implementations, and to distinguish the implementation of the language engine from the Python programming language itself. It is written in C.


**Python.py** --compiler--> **bytecode.pyc** --interpreter--> **native machine code** that can be understood by CPU

### Now back to GIL
- CPython has a Global Interpreter Lock because python is not thread safe.
- In order to support multi-threaded Python programs, thereâ€™s a global lock (GIL)
- GIL must be held by the current thread before it can safely access Python objects
- Python can only run threads serially, never in parallel
* Prevents multiprocessing power

#### heap stack
- Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures.
- how it relates to GIL?
  - objects can only be referenced by one thread (the one holding the GIL) at a time.
